# roku remote for mobile
This is an "app" that allows you to control your roku from your phone!
(yeah I know, theres already an app for that)

to use, simply copy and paste the contents of ```app.txt``` into your phones url bar (on IOS you must use safari, on android.. idk i havent tested it). then, scroll to the bottom and enter you roku's local IP adress (which is under ```settings > network > about``` on your roku), and youre ready to go! if you want, you can even change
